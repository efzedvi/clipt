.br
.B clipt 
.I [<server options>]
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B clipt 
is CLI (Command Line Interface) Pomodoro Timer. Although the name mentions command line, 
it is flexible enough to be equipped with and support a GUI. It's a multi-user program
that allows every user of the system have their own Pomodoro timer. To learn more about 
Pomodoro Timer, refer to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique
.P
Running 
.B clipt
without any options ( or any options except -c ) enters it into server mode, where it becomes a daemon.
While in server mode, it can be interacted with through its Unix Domain Socket interface.
The daemon creates and listens on a socket called ".clipt.sock" under the user's home
directory. It makes the socket accessible only by the user.
Daemon settings can be saved in a file called ".clipt.rc" under the user's home directory.
These settings are loaded every time 
.B clipt 
runs. However, command line options take priority and override them.
.P
Passing -c (--command) to 
.B clipt
makes it the client to the daemon. Refer to option -c below to learn more about the 
commands that can be sent to the daemon.
